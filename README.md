# Python-code-for-math-modeling-course
This repository contains a collection of Python examples and demos for the Math 471 Mathematical Modeling course I taught at the University of Puget Sound in the Spring of 2022.

Topics covered include discrete dynamical systems, linear and polynomial regression, measures for fitting models to data, splines, Markov chains, Monte Carlo simulations, and techniques for generating random variates from different distributions.
